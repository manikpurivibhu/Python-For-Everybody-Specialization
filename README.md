# Python-For-Everybody-Specialization
This repository contains all my assignments, codes and other necessary files for the Coursera's course "Python for Everybody"

"Python for Everybody" or "PY4E" is a great course available on Coursera and some other platforms for beginners to learn how to program.

The specialization is split into 5 courses which begins the students' journey from things as simple as RAM and ROM and finally producing 3 
decent Projects at the end of this specialization while scrapping the surface of various topics including APIs, JSON, SQL and what not.

This repository contains all of the assignment codes, projects and necessary files that I either created from scrap or downloaded from the instructor's
website. However, since this was my first Course and this was supposed to be my private collection, the code is not as clean as you would expect it to be.

Do enjoy this repository though, and try to code mostly on your own. 

Cleaner code is always appreciated at my Github account.
